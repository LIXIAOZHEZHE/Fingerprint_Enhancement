# Fingerprint recognition 
Till now I have studied and implemented:
### Fingerprint Enhancement algorithm
The fingerprint enhancement algorithm consists of the following steps:
* Normalisation
* Segmentation
* Ridge orientation
* Ridge Frequency
* Gabor filtering
* Binarization
* Thinning
###     Fingerprint Minutiae extraction
* Minutiae extraction
* False minutiae elimination
* Core point detection
