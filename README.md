        Till now I have studied and implemented:
###     Fingerprint Enhancement algorithm
        The fingerprint enhancement algorithm consists of the following steps:
        1. Normalisation
        2. Segmentation
        3. Ridge orientation
        4. Ridge Frequency
        5. Gabor filtering
        7. Binarization
        8. Thinning
###     Fingerprint Minutiae extraction
        1.Minutiae extraction
        2.False minutiae elimination
        3.Core point detection
